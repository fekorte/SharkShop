# SharkShop

First Java project, created as part of my programming classes. 

Shark themed eshop, 
create an account as a client and select items in your shopcart,
buy them and get a receipt. 

Users which are registered as an employee can add new items to the stock or increase and decrease the current stock.
System keeps track of all actions related to items in a logbook.

# SharkShop

My first Java project, created as part of my programming classes together with @NathaMora. 

Shark themed eshop. 
Create an account as a client and select items in your shopcart,
buy them and get a receipt. 

Users which are registered as an employee can register new employees and add new items to the stock or increase/decrease the current stock.
System keeps track of all actions related to items in a logbook.
